Knot Game Engine


## Framework

### Object control system

Knot is using Node Object-control system. It means that every game logic element is a Node or its child.
For example:
> Node (Scene)
> > Node2D (Player)
> > > Sprite
> > > CollisionShape2D


## Future notes
- Using emscripten for converting engine code to WebAsm
